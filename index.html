                    We believe children should stay children as long as they
                    need and the fact that they enter 1st grade should not end
                    their childhood. We intertwine playing and learning at such
                    an early age and encourage our students to enjoy learning.

                <h2>about us</h2>
                <p>
                    We began as a visionary venture in 1998 when Dr. Gabriel and
                    Alish Black, world-class academics in the field of
                    economics, endeavored to find a way to prepare students for
                    college and the real world better than schools did at the
                    time. They quickly found that the best way to make students
                    thrive was simple: challenge them. After opening their first
                    school in 1998, the Blocks discovered that students, when
                    given a well-crafted curriculum and teachers who truly cared
                    about teaching it, were able to learn at exceedingly high
                    levels, meeting and surpassing the best students in the
                    world. What began as a single campus has grown to become a
                    unique, high-achieving, and unprecedented network of
                    schools.
