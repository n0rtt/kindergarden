                We believe children should stay children as long as they need
                and the fact that they enter 1st grade should not end their
                childhood. We intertwine playing and learning at such an early
                age and encourage our students to enjoy learning.

                We began as a visionary venture in 1998 when Dr. Gabriel and
                Alish Black, world-class academics in the field of economics,
                endeavored to find a way to prepare students for college and the
                real world better than schools did at the time. They quickly
                found that the best way to make students thrive was simple:
                challenge them. After opening their first school in 1998, the
                Blocks discovered that students, when given a well-crafted
                curriculum and teachers who truly cared about teaching it, were
                able to learn at exceedingly high levels, meeting and surpassing
                the best students in the world. What began as a single campus
                has grown to become a unique, high-achieving, and unprecedented
                network of schools.
